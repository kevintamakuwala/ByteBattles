ByteBattles is a web-based competitive programming platform built using Spring Boot for the backend and ReactJS for the frontend. It provides a comprehensive environment for both admins and users to engage in competitive programming challenges, contests, and problem-solving activities.

## Functionalities

### Admin

- **Problem Management**: Administrators can perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on problems. This includes adding new problems, editing existing ones, and removing outdated or irrelevant ones.
- **Contest Management**: Admins have full control over creating, managing, and scheduling contests. They can set contest durations, rules, and other parameters.
- **Tag Management**: Tags help categorize problems for easier navigation and recommendation. Admins can manage tags by creating, editing, or deleting them as needed.
- **Test Case Management**: Admins can upload and manage test cases for problems to ensure accurate evaluation of user submissions.
- **Submission Monitoring**: Admins have access to view and delete user submissions. This feature helps maintain the integrity of the platform by managing inappropriate or invalid submissions.
- **Monitoring via Charts**: ByteBattles provides visual insights into platform usage and performance through interactive charts. Admins can monitor various metrics such as user activity, submission trends, and contest participation.

### User

- **Registration**: ByteBattles supports user registration, which requires email verification. This ensures the security and authenticity of user accounts and prevents misuse of the platform.
- **Problem Solving**: Users can solve individual problems available on the platform. They can submit their solutions and receive feedback on correctness and efficiency.
- **Contest Participation**: Users can participate in scheduled contests within a specified time frame. They can solve a set of problems within the contest duration.
- **Problem Recommendations**: Based on a user's past accuracy and performance in specific problem tags, ByteBattles offers personalized problem recommendations. This feature helps users improve their skills by focusing on areas where they need more practice.
- **Progress Tracking**: Users can track their progress over time through visual charts. These charts display metrics such as difficulty-wise solved problems and overall performance.
- **Submission Status**: Users can view the status of their submissions, including whether they are accepted, rejected, or have Runtime Errors.
